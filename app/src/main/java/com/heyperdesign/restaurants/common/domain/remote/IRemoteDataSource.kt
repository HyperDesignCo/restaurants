/**
 * Interface for handling all Remote Requests in a generic matter
 * [ Post method ]First endpoint ( /endpoint)
 * [ Post method ]Second params for request parameters of type map<String, Any> so the string is the key any is the value
 * [ Post method ] Third headers for request headers of type map<String, Any> so the string is the key any is the value
 * [ Post method ]Fourth Request body of generic type because it can handle any type of data
 * [ Post method ] Serializer of type KSerializer so we can serialize response
 * [ Get method ]First endpoint ( /endpoint)
 * [ Get method ]Second params for request parameters of type map<String, Any> so the string is the key any is the value
 * [ Get method ] Third headers for request headers of type map<String, Any> so the string is the key any is the value
 * [ Get method ] Serializer of type KSerializer so we can serialize response
 * [ Get method ] It does not have Request Body because it is a get request
 * [ Put method ]First endpoint ( /endpoint)
 * [ Put method ]Second params for request parameters of type map<String, Any> so the string is the key any is the value
 * [ Put method ] Third headers for request headers of type map<String, Any> so the string is the key any is the value
 * [ Put method ]Fourth Request body of generic type because it can handle any type of data
 * [ Put method ] Serializer of type KSerializer so we can serialize response
 * [ Delete method ]First endpoint ( /endpoint)
 * [ Delete method ]Second params for request parameters of type map<String, Any> so the string is the key any is the value
 * [ Delete method ] Third headers for request headers of type map<String, Any> so the string is the key any is the value
 * [ Delete method ] Serializer of type KSerializer so we can serialize response
 * [ Delete method ] It does not have Request Body because it is a delete request
